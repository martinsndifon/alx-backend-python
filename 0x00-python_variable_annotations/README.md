# Type annotation in python
Type annotation in python is basically adding type hints in your python code to
make another reader at first glance explicitely know what types are used for the
different variables, objects, functions etc

Note: The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations.
They can be used by third party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.
